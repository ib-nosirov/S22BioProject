NW_VisibilityGraph    Visibility graph analysis of a time series.

  Constructs a visibility graph of the time series and returns various
  statistics on the properties of the resulting network.

 ---INPUTS:

  y, the time series (a column vector)

  meth, the method for constructing:
  			(i) 'norm': the normal visibility definition
  			(ii) 'horiz': uses only horizonatal lines to link nodes/datums

  maxL, the maximum number of samples to consider. Due to memory constraints,
                only the first maxL (6000 by default) points of time series are
                analyzed. Longer time series are reduced to their first maxL
                samples.

 ---OUTPUTS:

  Statistics on the degree distribution, including the mode, mean, spread,
  histogram entropy, and fits to gaussian, exponential, and power-law distributions.
